<!-- 1st day of week and last day of week -->

<!--
We came back together today and merged our two branches together. I was able to complete with Matt over the weekend the budget CRUD features and also add a Pie chart that dynamically changes with inputed values. Ah-ha moment was when we were able to get the form logic right away since we had done it on the trip page recently and it was fun to see stuff start to sink in.

We split into group and Matt and I have been working on the trip crud features, I also added a map api in my free time that I am pretty proud of. My AH HA moment is that we figured out how to use navigate.

We forgot to write our journal for last week. Today we worked on our tables and more well defining relationships between our tables. We also created budget queries and routers.

We just got back from break, we got authentication for the user account creation working. Pryanka drove most of the day and I also drove for a little bit. We worked quite well together problem solving and using the learn to get our project going.

I plan to rewatch the learn for FAST API so I can be more helpful as we continue throughout the week.

AH-HA moment? I would say when we finally starting to understand the learn for fast API and started moving forward.

We discussed who is responsible for what in the project aswell as when we will be updating our journals. We also began working on some of the columns in are database.

I plan to go over SQL database info to brush up on it and hopefully get more comfortable with it aswell as finish the project advice learn.

AH-HA moment? I think it would be when we finally got our framework done and agreed on.
