We forgot to write our journal for last week. Today we worked on our tables and more well defining relationships between our tables. We also created budget queries and routers.

We just got back from break, we got authentication for the user account creation working. Pryanka drove most of the day and I also drove for a little bit. We worked quite well together problem solving and using the learn to get our project going.

I plan to rewatch the learn for FAST API so I can be more helpful as we continue throughout the week.

AH-HA moment? I would say when we finally starting to understand the learn for fast API and started moving forward.

We discussed who is responsible for what in the project aswell as when we will be updating our journals. We also began working on some of the columns in are database.

I plan to go over SQL database info to brush up on it and hopefully get more comfortable with it aswell as finish the project advice learn.

AH-HA moment? I think it would be when we finally got our framework done and agreed on.
