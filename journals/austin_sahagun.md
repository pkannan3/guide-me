We discussed who is responsible for what in the project aswell as when we will be updating our journals. We also began working on some of the columns in are database.

I plan to go over SQL database info to brush up on it and hopefully get more comfortable with it aswell as finish the project advice learn.

AH-HA moment? I think it would be when we finally got our framework done and agreed on.
